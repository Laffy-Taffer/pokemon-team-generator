# pokemon-team-generator
Generates every type combination of 6 pokemon types

Teams are output into teams.csv as a base19 string. Each pair of characters is a pokemon, each character is one type.

Type combos which do not belong to any official pokemon have not been added. This already takes 5 days to finish running, I'm not gonna add in irrelevant data like that.
