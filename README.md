# pokemon-team-generator
Generates every type combination of 6 pokemon types where no more than 3 pokemon share a single weakness

Teams are output into teams.csv as a base19 string. Each pair of characters is a pokemon, each character is one type. See type key.csv for reference

Type combos which do not belong to any official pokemon have not been added. This already takes 5 days to finish running, I'm not gonna add in irrelevant data like that.
